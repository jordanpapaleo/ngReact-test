# React Angular Test

My goal for this POC is to validate building many micro applications with react while using angular to coordinate them.  I want to proove that we should build a ton small maneuverable attack boats instead of a giant battleship.

# Setup

- Clone or fork and clone
- `npm i`
- In one terminal run `npm run start:dev`
- In another one terminal run `npm start`.

# Todo

Feedback/issues/PRs are soooo welcome.  

I want to determine if this is a legitimate solution for using angular as a [framework for frameworks](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwi16evr-NXOAhVCbSYKHTj0DTMQtwIIHjAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbzjDYzOHSAE&usg=AFQjCNFNCnceUhxf1abM6BJmTFD1d3GcXA&sig2=YsAxONH4zSkzbeoBAvZuxg&bvm=bv.129759880,d.eWE)
